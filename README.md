### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room client created a game, Draw It or Lose It, operating solely on Android devices. They wanted to develop that game into a web-based game to serve multiple platforms. The software requirement they defined was to have a game implement the ability to take multiple teams while each team has multiple players assigned to them, ensure game and team names be unique, as well as ensuring only a single instance of a game exists in memory at any given time. 

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation I took particular care in analyzing the characteristics and techniques specific to each system's architectures to help find the client the best fit for their situation. The recommendations were thoroughly thought out and the information was researched by first understanding the shared resource articles and then trying to find the information myself.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Understanding the intentions while working through the design document aided in my understanding of developing the code as I better understood the meaning behind creating the functions. Without the document, I wouldn't understand the need for the use of Singletons as I have very little experience with that function, but I understood it was important to help ensure a single instance of a game exists. 

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise a part of these documents to revise I would choose to improve my information based on the server providers. I believe I should find accurate information straight from the sources and quote and cite them properly. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs can be interpreted through personal experience in utilizing similar, but different applications. Implementing the interpretations is done by ensuring the least privilege principle and creating a comprehensive UI. It's important to consider the user's needs while designing as they are the ones the applications are for, so if the UI is complicated or the privilege is overwhelming then it will ultimately become a bad experience. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The software designing was done incrementally after thoroughly researching the needs and applications of the specific Singleton function implementation. Once the research was done, a lot of trial and error occurred to ensure quality code. Strategies I would like to implement in the future would be to research a little less, in hopes I don't overwhelm myself with information, and try trial and error along with the research to help understand the concepts better.
